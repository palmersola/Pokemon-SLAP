## Description of our App
We decided to make a game where you can play as certain Pokemon trainers and fight a variety of Pokemons. You start by registering on our website. Then you can login using the username and password you registered with. Then you are asked to choose the character you want to play as. After you make your selection then you can start playing. The point of the game is to defeat Pokemons by SLAPPING them. After you defeat a Pokemon then you level up and your stats increase. The higher level you are, the harder it is to defeat your opponent.
